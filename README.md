## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode
For active development with automatic rebuilding and hot reload:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the Angular development server on `http://localhost:4200`

### Production Build
To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

### Preview Production Build
To preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automated)
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when a new release is created:

1. **Create a Release**: Go to your repository's "Releases" section and create a new release
2. **Automatic Deployment**: The workflow will automatically:
   - Run tests and linting
   - Build the application with the correct base href
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Manual GitHub Pages Deployment
For manual deployment to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run build:github-pages
```
Or using the legacy script:
```bash
npm run deploy:gh-pages
```

#### GitHub Pages Setup
To enable GitHub Pages deployment:
1. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will handle the rest automatically

### Self-Hosting
1. Build the production version: `npm run build:prod`
2. Copy the contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve the `index.html` file for all routes

## 🗄️ Data Storage

The application uses **IndexedDB** (browser-native database) with the following object stores:
- `pillars` - Zero Trust pillars with ordering
- `functionCapabilities` - Functions and capabilities linked to pillars
- `maturityStages` - Maturity level definitions (Initial, Advanced, Optimal)
- `technologiesProcesses` - Technologies and processes for assessment
- `assessmentResponses` - Assessment results and user responses

### Data Privacy
- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB
- **No External Servers**: No data is transmitted to external servers
- **Complete Privacy**: Your assessment data never leaves your device
- **Backup/Restore**: Export your data as JSON for backup or migration

### Building for Production

Build the application for production deployment:
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

The built application will be available in the `dist/` directory and can be deployed to any static web hosting service.
